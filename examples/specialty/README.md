# Specialty Example

This example demonstrates how to assert that an Agent has an elevated proficiency (“specialty”) for a specific Capability.

To use this example, load **both**:
- `ontologies/extensions/beast_specialty_ext.ttl`
- `examples/specialty/specialty_example.ttl`

Core concepts come from `beast_mode_ontology.ttl` (Agent, Capability, Task).
Specialty concepts come from the Specialty extension (SpecialtyAssertion, specialtyLevel, confidence).
